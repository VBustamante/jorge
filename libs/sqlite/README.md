# sqlite-amalgamation
- [Release History](https://www.sqlite.org/changes.html)
- [Chronology](https://www.sqlite.org/chronology.html)

This repository mirrors the [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
amalgamation, provided in order to be included in `git submodule/subtree` or
other `git` based, custom dependency managers.
It also comes with a `cmake` build script to easily make the library and the shell
application.

SQLite includes more than 100 files in `*.c` / `*.h`, but
> The [amalgamation](http://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html) contains
> everything you need to integrate SQLite into a larger project. Just copy the
> amalgamation into your source directory and compile it along with the other C
> code files in your project. ([A more detailed
        > discussion](http://www.sqlite.org/howtocompile.html) of the
        > compilation process is available.) You may also want to make use of
> the "sqlite3.h" header file that defines the programming API for SQLite. The
> sqlite3.h header file is available separately. The sqlite3.h file is also
> contained within the amalgamation, in the first few thousand lines. So if you
> have a copy of sqlite3.c but cannot seem to locate sqlite3.h, you can always
> regenerate the sqlite3.h by copying and pasting from the amalgamation.

## build by `cmake`
A static lib (`libsqlite3`) and the sqlite3 shell will be generated by the build
system.

```bash
# under Linux / OS X
$> mkdir .build
$> cd .build
$> cmake ..   # or cmake .. -G Ninja
$> make -j 2  # or ninja

# under Windows
$> mkdir .build
$> cd .build
$> cmake ..
$> cmake --build . --config Release -- /v:m
```

building of the shell application is disabled by default, to make it:
```bash
$> cmake .. -DBUILD_SHELL=ON
```

by `gcc` and `clang` it's also possible to build *sqlite3* as a shared library
by `cmake`:
```bash
# on gcc or clang (Linux or OS X)
$> cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
```

### SQLite3 build options
`SQLite` comes with a plenty of compile options, you can choose some of these
options:

- `BUILD_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB`
- `BUILD_ENABLE_FTS3`
- `BUILD_ENABLE_FTS5`
- `BUILD_ENABLE_ICU`
- `BUILD_ENABLE_JSON1`
- `BUILD_ENABLE_RBU`
- `BUILD_ENABLE_RTREE`

by:
```bash
# shell: Linux / OS X
$> ccmake .

# gui: Linux / OS X / Windows
$> cmake-gui .
```

SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html)
